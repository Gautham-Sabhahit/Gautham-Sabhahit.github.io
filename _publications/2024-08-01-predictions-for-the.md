While the initial discovery of GW150914 resulted in the detection of black holes larger than initially expected, it was the GW190521 event which truly challenged astrophysical assumptions about stellar evolution and black hole progenitors, as the components of GW190521 were firmly within the traditional Pair-Instability (PI) mass-gap â€“ a range of masses where no black holes were expected to be created due to PI supernovae (PISN). We investigate the possibility that this merger involved first generation black holes, and that the unexpectedly heavy 85 solar mass BH could be produced from fundamental stellar physics. We present the results of studies involving the stellar evolution code MESA, as we systematically vary several parameters of stellar physics (in particular mixing and mass loss) to test assumptions and build a population of potential black hole progenitors within the traditional PI gap.
