The link between hot and cool stellar outflows is shown to be critical for correctly predicting the masses of the most massive black holes (BHs) below the so-called pair-instability supernova (PISN) mass gap. Gravitational Wave (GW) event 190521 allegedly hosted an "impossibly" heavy BH of 85 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Here we show how our increased knowledge of both metallicity Z and temperature dependent mass loss is critical for our evolutionary scenario of a low-Z blue supergiant (BSG) progenitor of an initially approx 100 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> star to work. We show using MESA stellar evolution modelling experiments that as long as we can keep such stars above 8000 K such low-Z BSGs can avoid strong winds, and keep a very large envelope mass intact before core collapse. This naturally leads to the Cosmic Time dependent maximum BH function below the PISN gap.
