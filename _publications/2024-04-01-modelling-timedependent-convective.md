One-dimensional stellar evolution calculations produce uncertain predictions for quantities like the age, core mass, core compactness, and nucleosynthetic yields; a key source of uncertainty is the modeling of interfaces between regions that are convectively stable and those that are not. Theoretical and numerical work has demonstrated that there should be numerous processes adjacent to the convective boundary that induce chemical and angular momentum transport, as well as modify the thermal structure of the star. One such process is called convective penetration, wherein vigorous convection extends beyond the nominal convective boundary and alters both the composition and thermal structure. In this work, we incorporate the process of convective penetration in stellar evolution calculations using the stellar evolution software instrument MESA. We implement convective penetration according to the description presented by Anders et al. to to calculate a grid of models from the pre-main sequence to helium core depletion. The extent of the convective penetration zone is self-consistently calculated at each time step without introducing new free parameters. We find both a substantial penetration zone in all models with a convective core and observable differences to global stellar properties such as the luminosity and radius. We present how the predicted radial extent of the penetration zone scales with the total stellar mass, age, and metallicity of the star. We discuss our results in the context of existing numerical and observational studies.
