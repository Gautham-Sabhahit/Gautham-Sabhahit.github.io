excerpt: 'Very massive stars with masses over 100 Msun are key objects in the Universe for our understanding of chemical and energetic feedback in the Universe, but their evolution and fate are almost entirely determined by their 
wind mass loss. We aim to determine the mass of the most massive star known in the Local Group R136a1. For this we compute the first hydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium atmosphere models for both 
R136a1 (WN5h) as well as the binary system R144 (WN5/6h+WN6/7h) in the Tarantula nebula. Using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet code, we simultaneously empirically derive and theoretically predict mass-loss rates and wind velocities. By 
fitting synthetic spectra derived from these models to multi-wavelength observations, we constrain the stellar and wind properties of R144 and R136a1. We first determine the clumping stratification required by our hydro-models to 
fit the spectra of R144 by using the available dynamical mass estimates for the two components. We then utilise this clumping stratification in hydrodynamic models of R136a1 and estimate a mass of MHydro of 233 Msun. Remarkably, 
the estimated mass is close to and entirely consistent with chemical homogeneous mass relations. This present-day mass of 233 Msun provides a lower limit to the initial stellar mass, that could be far higher due to previous wind 
mass loss.'
