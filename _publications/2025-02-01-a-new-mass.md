excerpt: 'We present the first-ever hydrodynamical wind modelling of two very massive star systems in the Tarantula Nebula, using the PoWR atmosphere code. The first system, R144, is a binary composed of two WNh stars, while the second, R136a1, is the current record holder for the most massive known star in the Local Group. We utilize the next-generation hydrodynamical capabilities of PoWR to simultaneously empirically derive and theoretically predict wind properties for both systems. By coupling wind hydrodynamics with atmosphere modelling, we can also predict a mass of 233â€¯Msun for R136a1.'

Very massive stars with masses over 100 Msun are key objects in the Universe for our understanding of chemical and energetic feedback in the Universe, but their evolution and fate are almost entirely determined by their wind mass loss. We aim to determine the mass of the most massive star known in the Local Group R136a1. For this we compute the first hydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium atmosphere models for both R136a1 (WN5h) as well as the binary system R144 (WN5/6h+WN6/7h) in the Tarantula nebula. Using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet code, we simultaneously empirically derive and theoretically predict mass-loss rates and wind velocities. By fitting synthetic spectra derived from these models to multi-wavelength observations, we constrain the stellar and wind properties of R144 and R136a1. We first determine the clumping stratification required by our hydro-models to fit the spectra of R144 by using the available dynamical mass estimates for the two components. We then utilise this clumping stratification in hydrodynamic models of R136a1 and estimate a mass of $M_\mathrm{Hydro}$ of 233 Msun. Remarkably, the estimated mass is close to and entirely consistent with chemical homogeneous mass relations. This present-day mass of 233 Msun provides a lower limit to the initial stellar mass, that could be far higher due to previous wind mass loss.
